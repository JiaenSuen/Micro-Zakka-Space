# License-Plate-Recognition

License Plate Recognition is an automated system designed to detect and extract license plates from input images, recognize the characters on the plates, and output the vehicle registration number. The project combines Haar feature-based object detection with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for character recognition, providing an end-to-end solution for license plate analysis.  

The system works in two major phases :  

* Object Detection
* Text Recognition

This project serves as a foundational exploration into computer vision techniques applied in real-world scenarios such as traffic monitoring, automated parking systems, and smart surveillance.
